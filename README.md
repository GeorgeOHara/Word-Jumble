# Word-Jumble
This project supplies the user with a jumbled word and times the user while they try to come up with the solution.
The purpose of the project was to combine my html, css, javascript, jquery, sql, and php skills together while using json and ajax so that data could be shifted back and forth between front end and back end without reloading the screen each time.
